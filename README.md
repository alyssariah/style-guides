# My Style Guides

A style guide is a set of standards about how code should be written and organized. It provides readable code, clear guidelines , and naming conventions. With a style guide, development become more efficient, scalable, and professional.

To ensure code consistency and maintainability within my projects, I am using the standards in the following guides:
- [Sass Guide](Sass/README.md)
- [HTML Guide](HTML/README.md)
- [Javascript Guide](Javascript/README.md)
- [React Guide](React/README.md)
  
## Motivation

To write clean and consistent code, a style guide is a **MUST**. No two developers code the exact same way and even the same developer may not write the code the same way. These guides hellp a developer get up to speed on code quicker and easier.

> "All code in any code-base should look like a single person typed it, no matter how many people contributed."

>"A team following a style guide helps everyone write code in a consistent way, and consistent code is easier to read and faster to update. Consistent code is easier to read and understand making it faster to add new features."

## Contributing 

These style guides are living documents. As development grows, these documents will grow and be tweaked to work for development. Issues that raise questions, justify changes on technical merits, or point out obvious mistakes can be made through pull requests. Primarily changes should be made to optimize internal needs.
